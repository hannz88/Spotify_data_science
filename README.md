## Introduction
This is data science side-project. Firstly, I gathered the information and track details of a few playlists from Spotify. The details are accessed using Spotipy which have wrapper functions for Spotify's RESTfuls API. The details are then used to analyze the difference between some of them. Prior to using Spotipy, remember to get the client id and client secret from Spotify Developer's Website.

## Getting keys for Spotify
As the codes use the Spotipy library, make sure you have Spotipy installed first. All methods in Spotipy requires authorization using `Client ID` and `Client Secret` which is available through [Spotify's Developer site](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login).
